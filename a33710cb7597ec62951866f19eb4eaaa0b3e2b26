      "message": "arcee (since it looks like you added these lines): is this a sufficient check for whether or not we\u0027ve got NEON extensions? arm64 has NEON by default, but in my build it doesn\u0027t appear to have turned on ARCH_ARM_HAVE_NEON. Do we need to alter this check, or should TARGET_ARCH\u003darm64 --\u003e ARCH_ARM_HAVE_NEON\u003dtrue?",
